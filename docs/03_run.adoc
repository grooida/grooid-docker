== Running

Go to the directory where you project/s are located and execute:

[source, shell]
----
[user@mypc my-android-project]$ docker-android
----

NOTE: If the command is not found you can always execute the command
including the whole path
`/home/youruser/../grooid-docker/bin/docker-android.sh`

And after a few seconds a `tmux` session will open up with three
windows and in one of them an Android Studio will be executed.
